            <p>Before establishing a connection between the front end i.e your Java Program and the back end i.e the database we should learn what precisely a JDBC is and why it came into existence. Now let us discuss what exactly JDBC stands for and will ease out with the help of real-life illustration to get it working.  <br>

                <h2>What is JDBC? </h2>
                <br>
                JDBC is an acronym for Java Database Connectivity. Itâ€™s an advancement for ODBC ( Open Database Connectivity ). JDBC is a standard API specification developed in order to move data from frontend to the backend. This API consists of classes and interfaces written in Java. It basically acts as an interface (not the one we use in Java) or channel between your Java program and databases i.e it establishes a link between the two so that a programmer could send data from Java code and store it</p>

                <p>Why JDBC Come into Existence? <br>

                    As previously told JDBC is an advancement for ODBC, ODBC being platform-dependent had a lot of drawbacks. ODBC API was written in C, C++, Python, and Core Java and as we know above languages (except Java and some part of Python )are platform-dependent. Therefore to remove dependence, JDBC was developed by a database vendor which consisted of classes and interfaces written in Java. 
                    
                    <h3>Steps For Connectivity Between Java Program and Database</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Import the Packages</li>
                    <li>Load the drivers using the forName() method </li>
                    <li>Register the drivers using DriverManager </li>
                    <li>Establish a connection using the Connection class object</li>
                    <li>Create a statement</li>
                    <li>Execute the query</li>
                    <li>Close the connections</li>
                
                </ul>
